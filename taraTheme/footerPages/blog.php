        <h1>Not Here Yet</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately the blog section of the website isn’t here yet. 
            Sometimes things go as planned and sometimes they don't, 
            unfortunately this is one of the instances in which they don’t. 
            We encourage you to look for blogging sites and forums outside of this one!</p>

        <h1>What to Expect</h1>
        <p>You can expect to find other members who want the same environmental change as you and we do. 
            You’ll encourage each other to become aware of pollution as well as 
            helping each other plan together outfits or deciding whether a purchase is really necessary or not.</p>
