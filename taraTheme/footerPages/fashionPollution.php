        <h1>Consumer Choice</h1>
        <p>The choices we make as consumers influence the world, in the case of fashion, 
            our choices to make impulse decisions and buy low cost clothing, 
            we see the cost being offset to the environment. 
            Our behaviour as consumers not only affects us but the world around us. </p>
            
        <h1>How will this Help?</h1>
        <p>This won’t end pollution, we won’t find an environmentally friendly alternative to polyester, 
            but we will support the efforts to push for sustainability. Rather than give up, 
            we should acknowledge the actions we can take to alleviate the effects of fashion pollution, 
            until a permanent solution is found.</p>
